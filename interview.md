1. What is the difference between `process.nextTick()`, `setImmediate()`, and `setTimeout()`?

# 2. Explain the Event Loop in Node.js with phases.

âœ… Event Loop Phases

Timers Phase â€“ handles setTimeout() and setInterval() callbacks.

Pending Callbacks â€“ executes some deferred system callbacks.

Poll Phase â€“ waits and retrieves new I/O events.

Check Phase â€“ executes setImmediate() callbacks.

Close Callbacks â€“ executes clean-up events like socket closures.

ðŸš«Use Cases

Web servers handling multiple clients.

File operations without freezing the app.

Real-time apps like chat or gaming servers.

# 3. What are streams in Node.js? How are they different from buffers?

Streams are objects in Node.js that allow you to read or write data continuously, in chunks, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once. They are designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently, such as reading from a file, receiving network data, or processing data in real-time. Streams are particularly useful for tasks where data is too large to fit in memory or arrives incrementally.

Types of Streams
Node.js provides four main types of streams:

Readable: Used to read data (e.g., reading a file or HTTP request body). Examples: fs.createReadStream, HTTP request streams.
Writable: Used to write data (e.g., writing to a file or HTTP response). Examples: fs.createWriteStream, HTTP response streams.
Duplex: Streams that are both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).
Transform: A type of duplex stream that can modify or transform data as it is read or written (e.g., zlib for compression).

| Aspect              | Streams                                                                      | Buffers                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Handle continuous data flow in chunks, ideal for large or streaming data.    | Store and manipulate fixed-size binary data in memory.                       |
| **Memory Usage**    | Memory-efficient; processes data in small chunks without loading everything. | Loads entire data into memory, which can be memory-intensive for large data. |
| **Data Processing** | Processes data incrementally, often asynchronously, using events.            | Processes data all at once, synchronously or asynchronously.                 |
| **Use Case**        | Reading/writing large files, network I/O, real-time data processing.         | Handling binary data, encoding/decoding, small data manipulation.            |
| **Type**            | Event-driven objects (Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform).                | Raw binary data container (fixed-size byte array).                           |
| **Examples**        | `fs.createReadStream`, HTTP request/response, zlib streams.                  | `Buffer.from('text')`, reading file content into memory.                     |
| **Piping**          | Supports piping to chain streams (e.g., `readStream.pipe(writeStream)`).     | No piping; buffers are static and donâ€™t inherently support streaming.        |
| **Backpressure**    | Handles backpressure to manage data flow between producer and consumer.      | No backpressure; entire buffer is processed at once.                         |

âœ… Example â€“ Reading a File Using a Readable Stream

```
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a readable stream from a file
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('large-file.txt', {
    encoding: 'utf8',
    highWaterMark: 1024 // bytes per chunk
});

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Finished reading file');
});

readableStream.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
});
```

```
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a writable stream to a file
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Write some data to the file
writableStream.write('Hello, streaming!\n');
writableStream.write('Writing another line.\n');

// Close the stream
writableStream.end(() => {
    console.log('Finished writing to file');
});
```

```
Copy data from one to another..
const fs = require('fs');

// Create readable and writable streams
const readable = fs.createReadStream('large-file.txt');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('copy-file.txt');

// Pipe data from readable stream to writable stream
readable.pipe(writable);

writable.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('File copied successfully!');
});

```

4. How does Node.js handle child processes?

| Use Case                          | Example                              |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Running shell commands            | File management, system monitoring  |
| Parallel processing               | Performing heavy computations       |
| Communication between processes   | Managing tasks across multiple Node instances |
| Working with external tools       | Running Python scripts, image conversion |
| Microservices architecture        | Splitting tasks into smaller processes |

5. What is middleware in Express.js?

middleware refers to functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects, and the next() function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as executing code, modifying requests and responses, ending the request-response cycle, or calling the next middleware in the stack.

âœ… Types of Middleware

âœ… Application-level middleware â€“ Defined on the Express app using app.use() or app.METHOD().

âœ… Router-level middleware â€“ Defined on routers.

âœ… Error-handling middleware â€“ Handles errors specifically with four arguments: (err, req, res, next).

âœ… Built-in middleware â€“ Provided by Express like express.json(), express.static().

âœ… Third-party middleware â€“ Libraries like cors, body-parser, morgan, etc.
